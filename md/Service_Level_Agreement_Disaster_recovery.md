# Disater recovery

A disaster is any unplanned event that causes the total interruption of the production runtime.

In order to protect your busines from such event, Bonita Cloud has put in place a **D**isaster **R**ecovery **P**lan.

The goal of our disaster recovery plan is to guarantee the continuity of the customer business.

In case of disaster, Bonitasoft targets for its production runtime:

* To recover the service within 15 minutes (**R**ecovery **T**ime **O**bjective: 15 minutes)
::: info
Recovery Time Objective or RTO is a metric that helps to calculate how quickly Bonitasoft targets to recover its IT infrastructure and services following a disaster in order to maintain the customerâ€™s business continuity
:::

* To limit the data loss to 1 minute (**R**ecovery **P**oint **O**bjective: 1 minute)
::: info
Recovery Point Objective or RPO is a metric to define the maximum tolerable amount of data that can be lost following a disaster.
